## What I reminded?

### Architecture

- What is `ISP`.
- What is `DIP`.
  - Why `interfaces` are more stable than `implementation`.
- What are `components`.
  - What is `components consistency` and what rules do we have here.
    - What is `REP`.
    - What is `CCP`.
      - How it's an incarnation of `SRP` and `OCP` on the component level.
    - What is `CRP`.
      - How it's an incarnation of `ISP` on the component level.
  - How to connect `components`.
    - What is `ADP` and what are the solutions to the broken dependencies graph.
      - What is `weekly compilation` and why it's discouraged as a solution.
      - How to remove `dependency cycles` using `DIP` or creating an `in-between component`.
    - What is `SDP`.
      - What is `instability` of the `component` and when it's useful or not.
    - What is `SAP`.
      - What is `abstraction` of the `component` and how it relates to the `stability`.
