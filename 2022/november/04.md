- What is `CQRS`.
  - How it is an upgrade of `CQS`.
  - Where it is used.
  - What are the ways of synchronizing the models.
  - How to apply `CQRS` to legacy.
  - How separate databases for reads and writes can help scale databases.
  - What is `eventual consistency` and when it's worth using.
  - What is `one-way command` and how it's different from a regular command.
  - What are possible ways to process commands in `CQRS`.
- What are `Long running processes (LRP)`.
  - What are `local processes` and how they're different from `LRPs`.
  - `Sagas` vs `Process manager` patterns.
  - Why it's worth using well established libraries and tools for implementing those tasks.
