## What I learned?

### Architecture

- What are the `aggregates`.
  - What are the problems with `anemic model` and how to solve those problems, by introducing `rich models` with `aggregates`.
  - How aggregates define transaction boundaries.
  - How to persist `aggregates`.
  - How to model `aggregates` step by step.
- What is [Notification Pattern](https://martinfowler.com/articles/replaceThrowWithNotification.html) and how it can be an alternative to `throwing errors` in certain situations.
