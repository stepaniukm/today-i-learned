## What I reminded?

### Architecture

- What are `humble objects`.
  - How `views` and `presenters` are example of `humble object` pattern.
  - How `humble objects` are especially useful close to the `boundaries`.
- What are `partial boundaries`.
  - Why sometimes using `one dimensional boundary` is better.
  - Why sometimes use even weaker boundaries with the `facade` pattern.
- How `boundaries` between `layers` are not always needed to be `strong`.
  - How to find the proportions between `strong` and `partial` boundaries in order not to break YAGNI rules.
- What is the `Main component` and how it should be treated from the architecture perspective.
- Why `SOA` isn't as good as it's advertised.
  - How separation and independent development of services are the two biggest overstatements about `SOA`.
- How `tests` are still a part of the system and good architecture acknowledges it.
  - How the system should facilitate testing.
- How we should focus on writing software and not `firmware`. (here firmware is not used exactly in its meaning)
  - How being dependent on the platform, certain library or framework is an example of `firmware`.
- Why the `database` is only an architectural detail.
