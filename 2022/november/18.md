## What I learned?

### Architecture

- What is `coupling`.
  - What are the kinds of `coupling` based on communication between modules.
  - What are the characteristics and differences between `loose` and `tight coupling`.
  - What are the characteristics and differences between `explicit` and `implicit` coupling`.
  - What is `semantic` and `logical coupling`.
  - What are the `coupling metrics`.
  - How important is `variability` in `coupling metrics`. Why being dependent on 5 stable modules might be better than depending on 2 instable modules.
  - What is the `design for removability`.
  - What is `Law of Demeter` and why it's considered good practice.
