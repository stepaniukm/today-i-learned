## What I reminded?

### Architecture

- What are `resources` in `REST`.
  - What are the characteristics of `HTTP Methods`.
  - What are the `response code groups` and what are the most common `response codes`.
  - What are possible representations of `resources`.
  - How to handle `Dates` over HTTP.
- What are the connections between `REST` and `domain`.
  - What are the differences between `domain entity` and `REST resource`.
  - Why avoid mapping 1:1 between entities and resources.
