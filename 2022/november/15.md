## What I reminded?

### Architecture

- How WWW is only a detail.
  - Why it's only a detail given it's some kind of user interface that always is a detail.
  - How the distribution of computing power oscillates like a pendulum between client and server.
- Why framework is only a detail.
  - Why the relationship between the developer and framework's author is in its nature asymmetric.
  - What risks accompany binding tight with a framework.
