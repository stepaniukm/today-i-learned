## What I learned?

### Architecture

- What are the ways to transport events.
  - What is `simple event relay` and how it differs from `static publisher`.
  - What are the kinds of `side effects` and how to deal with each of those.
  - What are the differences between `one` and multi-transaction` transport`.
  - What are possible `delivery guarantees`

## What I reminded?

- What is an `Outbox Pattern` (aka `Store and Forward`) and how it guarantees delivery of an event.
