## What I learned?

### GraphQL

- How awesome [The Guild Ecosystem](https://the-guild.dev/) is in terms of building a Node.js GraphQL server.
- How to use type safety of Pothos in the best possible way.

### Node.js

- Today Node.js v18.11.0 was released including long awaited flag `--watch` allowing us better developer experience without additional tools.

## What I reminded?

### Architecture

- It starts with code so we have to understand 3 programming paradigms: structural, object-oriented and functional.
- Every paradigm takes something away from us.
