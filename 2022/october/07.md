## What I learned?

### Architecture

- The original story behind Event Storming. I read the first [blog post](http://ziobrando.blogspot.com/2013/11/introducing-event-storming.html) by Alberto Brandolini

### What I reminded

- As I went through all the materials from this week's DNA, I revised today all I learned so far.
- I returned today to [Node.js Best Practices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices#1-project-structure-practices) and [Tao of Node](https://alexkondov.com/tao-of-node/#validate-middleware).
