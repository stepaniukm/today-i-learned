## What I learned?

### Architecture

- Today I had my first Event Storming session in my side project. I learned a lot during it as I was a leader.
- How important is it to keep technical debt under control. I'm now refactoring code that is mixing all of the different abstraction levels and is so poorly typed and written that I have no idea how it works, but it's a great sandbox to test my skills in refactoring.
