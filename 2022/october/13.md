As again I ran out of materials early this week in DNA, I continue with `Clean Architecture` from Uncle Bob.

## What I learned?

### Other

- Testing software automatically is tough but gives so much control and just a feeling of stability. After extracting core functionality to nice and clean functions testing them was super easy and made me feel sure that the software I deliver is of good quality. I haven't used to pay much attention to tests in my previous company, but I feel I matured a lot recently and want to develop more skills here.

## What I reminded?

### Architecture

- Why being over-self-confident is a perfect way to terrible architecture.
- The system consists of behavior and structure, and programmers tend to keep only one of them of good quality.
- The software has to remain `soft` in its nature, so it has to be changeable, adjustable, and maintainable.
- The cost of adding a change should be proportional to the scope of the change and not the shape.
- What is `Eisenhower Matrix` and how it helps prioritize things.
