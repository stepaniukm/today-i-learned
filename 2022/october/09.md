## What I learned?

### Math

- I learned how simple paradox `This sentence is false` was an inspiration to famous `GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems` and also Turing's `Halting Problem` solution.
- How self-referencing is so tricky to handle in proofs.

### GraphQL

- GQL has the concept of [directives](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#directives) and they're damn useful but for some reason, I haven't seen them in production code yet.
- GQL has [interfaces](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#interfaces), also for I have no damn clue, why I haven't encountered this yet, but here I go.

## What I reminded?

### Architecture

I started reading again `Clean architecture` by Uncle Bob.

- What are project and architecture.
- What are the signs of bad architecture.
- What is the ultimate goal of architecture.
