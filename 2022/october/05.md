## What I learned?

### Architecture

- How to prepare for `Big Picture Event Storming` session.
- What are alternatives to `BPES`.
- What are the phases of `BPES`.
- What is `priming` and why do we want to avoid it.
- What are `swimlanes` in the context of `BPES` and what alternatives do we have here.
- How to document what we learned during `BPES`.

### Other

- How important is `thinking outside the box` and pushing your ideas, in the context of software development. Basically, we had a problem within our application that we struggled to resolve technically. I myself had a feeling that something is weird in our flow, but I just assumed that it was the best and most carefully thought solution and just didn't have enough courage to suggest it. But as always:
  > Assumption is the Mother of All Fuck Ups.
It may be obvious, but I get a lot into this trap of `assumption`. I have to be more mindful about my decisions as I'm vulnerable to `assuming` a lot and just don't want to make this mistake anymore (or at least not that often). So once again let's remember:
