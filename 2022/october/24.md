## What I learned?

### Architecture

- That is `three-layer architecture`.
- How dependencies works in `layered architecture` in theory and in reality.
- How to solve the issue with dependencies.
- What are the types of layers (rigid and loose).
- What is consistency in terms of layers. Why it's sometimes worth to have more `eclectic` modules and not `homogeneous`.
- What are the different types of shared modules.
- What are the differences between `tiers` and `layers`.
- What are the pros and cons of `multitier architecture`.

### Curios

## What I reminded?

### Architecture

- What is `ISP` in the context of architecture.
