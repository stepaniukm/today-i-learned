## What I learned?

### React

- How exactly works experimental `Suspense for Data Fetching` in React. I implemented my own `wrapPromise` function that allowed me to use suspense. I also tried `@tanstack/react-query` with `suspense` enabled on some basic resources.

### Node.js

- There is a package called [Nact](https://nact.xyz/) that enables `actor architecture` in Node.js. I experimented with it a little bit and I have to say it's interesting for me as I had some experience with `Akka` in `Scala`.

## What I reminded?

### Architecture

- What is `OCP` in the context of architecture.
- How `OCP` helps us create maintainable software.
