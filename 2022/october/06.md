## What I learned?

### Architecture

- How to talk with businesses to get as many metrics as we can.
- The language of business is the language of solutions, not problems.
- What are `SMART` and `SMARTER` metrics frameworks.
- What are the kinds of metrics. What are the characteristics of `technical` and `business` metrics within our system.
- How to find metrics.

### Other

- Attention to detail is really important and it's not only a catchy slogan. Today on my frontlive stream I was surprised, at how on earth, the feature I tried to migrate from my other project, was giving some errors when the code was the same. The solution was not that difficult as there was a difference in TypeScript configuration, but still, despite my experience, I freaked out a little bit. It's important to keep a cool head, and don't get distracted by some weird errors, and try to approach the issue logically at all costs.
