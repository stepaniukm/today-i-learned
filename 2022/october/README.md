# October 2022

This is where my journey begins. A few days ago during Meet.js, I was inspired by a talk `Architektura heksagonalna w NestJS (Hexagonal architecture in NestJS) ` and decided October will be the month of architecture. I'm taking a part in [DNA](https://droganowoczesnegoarchitekta.pl/). This is a Polish course about architecture on different levels. For a long time, I planned to get to this topic more seriously, but I simply had more important things in my head. I wanted to stabilize my knowledge in more crucial areas for a Regular Fullstack Developer. Now as I got a stable job, I can bring my attention closer to software architecture again. Besides the course, I have also several books on my Kindle, so I'll try to read them more regularly. I'll start with repeating the ultimate classic `Clean Architecture` by Uncle Bob and then we'll see what others will be recommended to me by my more experienced friends.
