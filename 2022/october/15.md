## What I reminded?

### Architecture

- How structural programming founded a basis for most of the programming languages.
- Why is exactly `goto` i.e. direct and unlimited passing of control harmful.
- What is `functional decomposition` and how it helps create maintainable software.
- How `testing` in software development is just an implementation of `scientific method`. We can't prove the program is correct, but we can prove it's good enough.
- The story behind `OOP` and how it's mostly `polymorphism` that characterizes it and not `encapsulation` and `inheritance` that were known and used well before and independently of `OOP`.
- How `dependency inversion` allowed us to create plug-in architecture.
- How immutability helps design safe architecture.
- Practical application of FP patterns in architecture in example of `Event Sourcing`.
- Why the whole system can't be designed with `functional paradigm` only in mind.
