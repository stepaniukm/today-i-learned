## Context

I already swallowed all materials from this week's DNA so today on the topic of architecture I didn't learn all that much, but still got recommended some materials and have a look at them. More than this I decided to fill the gaps in my git knowledge and dig into this more.

## What I learned?

### Architecture

- I tried to analyze an example of [Allegro Hexagonal Architecture](https://blog.allegro.tech/2020/05/hexagonal-architecture-by-example.html). I think overall it's an interesting concept, but code examples are written in Java which has a tremendous amount of boilerplate. I'll try to use some ideas from `hexagonal architecture` in my next projects (namely [frontlive/start-coding](https://github.com/Frontlive/Start-Coding), but with reduced code mess and focused on important things)

### Git

- Git has something called `bare repository` and this is the reason projects on GitHub end with `.git`, that's the convention
- You don't have to add the whole file to git, you can decide for each `hunk` whether you want to add it with `git add --patch` command.
- `git clean` command with multiple switches `-dnifx` is very useful and not that often mentioned in courses
- `git check-ignore` can check (as the name suggests) whether the path is tracked by git
- `git update-index --assume-unchanged` can stop tracking already added to the git path
- `git clone` has a switch called `--depth` which allows us to clone only a certain number of commits instead of a full repo.
- How exactly `git bisect` works
- There is a command `git filter-branch` that is so freaking powerful
- I systematized my knowledge about how the git works in depth.
